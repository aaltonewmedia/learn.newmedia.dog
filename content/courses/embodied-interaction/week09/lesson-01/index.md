## AI Tools

### OpenAI GPT and Whisper (audio-to-text)

For TouchDesigner there are nice components created by Torin Blankensmith

If you want to learn a little bit more in-depth how to work with the API, this tutorial goes through the process of writing the code from scratch.

{{<hint danger>}}
Note that you will need an API key to work with the OpenAI components. You can find the key in MyCourses and you can use it during this class as long as you use it moderately. The API key will be deleted after the course. If you plan to use OpenAI in your project, come talk to Matti and we will create a separate key for you.
