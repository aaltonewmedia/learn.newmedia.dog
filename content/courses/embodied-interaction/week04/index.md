For the last two weeks we have been exploring in general some different ways that humans have interacted with technology (and each other). Today we expand from Tangible Interaction into the space around us.

In the upcoming weeks, we are going to focus on how the space around you and the objects in that space can become part of your thinking.

Mark Weiser called his ideas **Ubiquitous Computing** in 1988 in the form of computational, networked devices embedded to our surroundings and everyday objects in three different sizes: tabs, pads and boards.

Hiroshi Ishii and the Tangible Media Group call their vision **Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms** since the 1990s. As an example, a more physical or experimental version of the idea of Ubiquitous Computing was explored in the [ambientROOM project](https://tangible.media.mit.edu/project/ambientroom/).

Saul Greenberg has investigated **Proxemic Interaction** that builds on **Proxemics** by Edward T. Hall and many of the ideas above.

Bret Victor and collaborators are hoping to create a more **humane representation of thought**. The first prototype was called **Dynamicland** or **Realtalk**. Originally developed at the [Dynamicland space](https://dynamicland.org/2024/Intro/).

## Homework

### Get Familiar with TouchDesigner

I will give you a little break from the theory side. As we will jump into the more practical part of the course.

In order to be able to follow along next week, please go through (at minimum) the first segment (101) of the [TouchDesigner Fundamentals class](https://learn.derivative.ca/courses/100-fundamentals/lessons/101-navigating-the-environment/).

Don't just watch it, follow along and do it.

You can install the non-commercial version of the software or use Aalto computers for the Educational version.

You can also login remotely using [vdi.aalto.fi](vdi.aalto.fi)

### Tutoring

Matti will also do an additional TouchDesigner tutoring day if you need help or have any questions:

Friday, January 31  
Experimental Studio 1 (Marsio, 3430)  
9:00–17:00 (lunch break 12-13)

I will be in the studio all day, come and drop by at any point to ask questions or to get a short private tutoring lesson (one-on-one or small groups).
