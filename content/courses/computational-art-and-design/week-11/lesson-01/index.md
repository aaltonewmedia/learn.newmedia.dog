## Using WebSocket

WebSocket is a communication protocol that allows you to send and receive data over the local network or the internet.

{{<hint info>}}
WebSockets could be used for chat rooms, multiplayer games, collaborative drawing tools etc.
{{</hint>}}

For this class, our server is going to be hosted on a service called Heroku, and all of us will create a client that connects to it. The specific library we use is [socket.io](https://socket.io/) that is based on WebSocket but adds a couple of extra features.

### socket.io library

Import the socket.io library to your sketch by adding the following line to your `index.html` file.

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.3.0/socket.io.js"></script>
```

### Server

For this class I have made a simple server that receives all incoming messages and broadcasts them to the other clients. See the link in MyCourses.

- [This is the code for the server I used](https://github.com/mnstri/node-socket.io/tree/main)
- [Documentation here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-websockets#option-2-socket-io)

The coding train tutorial shows how you could make your own server.

### Client | p5.js code

Our client allows each one to draw on the canvas and to choose the size and color of the brush. All drawings should be synced to the other clients.

```js
let socket;
let myPicker;
let slider;
let c;
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 800);
  socket = io.connect(" "); //Add the server url here. You can find it from Mycourses.
  socket.on('mouse', gotData);
  myPicker = createColorPicker('deeppink');
  slider = createSlider(1,30,10,1);
}

function draw() {
  //background(220);
}

function mouseDragged() {
  c = myPicker.color();
  let data = {
    x: mouseX,
    y: mouseY,
    r: c.levels[0],
    g: c.levels[1],
    b: c.levels[2],
    s: slider.value()
  };
  socket.emit("mouse", data);
  // Draw a circle with the defined color
  fill(c);
  noStroke();
  circle(data.x, data.y, data.s);
}

function gotData(data) {
  //console.log("Got: " + data.x + " " + data.y);
  fill(data.r,data.g,data.b);
  noStroke();
  circle(data.x, data.y, data.s);
}
```
