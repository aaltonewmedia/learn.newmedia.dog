## Course practicalities

### Weekly structure

The duration of the course is 7 weeks.
- 6 weeks of classes
- 7th week is the workshop week. No teaching but I would recommend reserving it for working on your final project.

We have three classes each week. They are divided like this:
- Mondays, 15:15–17:00 | Weekly lecture that brings some context to the hands-on work that we focus on during the rest of the week. Sometimes we have visiting lecturers.
- Tuesdays, 13:15–17:00 | Hands-on demonstrations and work on small assignments.
- Thursdays, 13:15–17:00 | Hands-on demonstrations and work on small assignments.
