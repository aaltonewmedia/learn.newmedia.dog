Simon Dreyer was working on the idea of the *cartesian split* between the mind and the body and created [Duo Dimension](https://www.simonarcher.design/accessible-realities).

>Duo Dimension is a two-player game centered on teamwork and designed for a single VR headset. While one player immerses themselves in the digital environment through the VR goggles, the other uses a controller to interact with the same digital space. Together, they create a connection between the digital and physical worlds.

## Homework

### Watch

Continue with the video lectures by Jelle van Dijk. This time about Tangible Interaction. Some things that I talked about are repeated but it might be a good recap to hear this from another person with a slightly different angle.

### Think

Whenever you go about your day, take some moments to think about the subconscious actions that you do throughout your everyday experiences. How do you interact with objects while cooking, eating, doing sports, commuting from one place to another etc.? How do you organise your space  around you for specific tasks? Or do you? What do you think you are  really skilled in?

Are there any specific gestures that are associated to these actions that you find interesting?

Could these actions be part of some type of an interactive experience.

Add some thoughts into our collaborative Miro board for the class. [You can find the link in MyCourses.](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/mod/url/view.php?id=1448734&forceview=1)
