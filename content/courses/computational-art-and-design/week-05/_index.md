**Choose one exercise per missed day of class.** Add your sketches to our [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/class/101465#/) class. There is a collection specifically for this. Name your file with the date that you are compensating for and the exercise name from the book. For example, `06/09 Butt Generator`.
