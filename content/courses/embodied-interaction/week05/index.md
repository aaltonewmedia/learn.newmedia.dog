## Using TouchDesigner with the Aalto licenses

You can download and use the non-commercial version on your own computer, but I would highly recommend working on the Aalto computers. We have a total 20 educational licenses available. The license is allocated to you when you launch the software. **It is not possible to get the Aalto license on your own computer.**

{{<hint warning>}}
Sometimes the license manager does not work and it cannot connect to the the server. In those cases, it seems that restarting the computer usually seems to fix the issue.

### Using the physical computers at Väre

These classrooms have TouchDesigner installed. You can use any of them when there is space.

- [Väre, Room K103](https://booking.aalto.fi/onlinekalenteri/aaltobooking/?kt=tila%2C39790&laji=Pajat+ja+piirustussalit&sijainti=R028&ctila=28174) (RTX 3080 GPUs)
- [Väre, Media Lab Homebase]() We also have some computers in the Media Lab Homebase rooms. Specifications differ from computer to computer. The best GPU is in room O102.

### Using vdi.aalto.fi to connect to the Aalto computers remotely
  
Log in to [vdi.aalto.fi](https://vdi.aalto.fi/) with your Aalto account and choose any of the rooms listed above and you should have access to a computer with TD installed.

This actually works really well and it's very convenient! Can be used with a low-power machine like a laptop with much better performance. Also great for using on your Mac to access some of the Windows-only features.
