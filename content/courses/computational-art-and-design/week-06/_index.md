## Absence Compensation

If you miss the classes this week and you are going over the 20% allowed absence, you can compensate for them with these exercises from the [course book](https://primo.aalto.fi/permalink/358AALTO_INST/ha1cg5/alma999439982606526):



One exercise per missed day of class. Add your sketches to our [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/class/92392) class. There is a collection specifically for this. Name your file with the date that you are compensating for and the exercise name from the book. For example, `06/09 Butt Generator`.
