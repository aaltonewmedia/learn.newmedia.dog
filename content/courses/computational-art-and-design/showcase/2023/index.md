## Volha Furs – Interactive Patterns

{{<vimeo 1005186143>}}

This project emerges from my participation in the Computational Art & Design course, encapsulating my journey of learning and experimentation with the p5.js library.

Meticulously designed, a series of dynamic elements is crafted through the utilisation of the p5.js library. With the assistance of a MIDI controller, individuals have the opportunity to explore an extensive array of combinations, giving rise to diverse patterns. The MIDI sliders control various shapes, while the knobs alter colours for each distinct form. As the Christmas season approaches, this project evokes a festive and playful atmosphere, inspiring enjoyable and highly visual experiments.

## Pili Valdivia – 3:34

*As the earthquakes shake the ground and destroy our surroundings, the tiles are a symbol of collectivity and reconstruction that reminds us of the value of resilience.*

The mixed media installation "3:34 am" consists of 60 tiles, each representing a single second in one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded, that occurred in Chile in 2010. The piece works as a data visualisation, showing the variation of displacement, velocity and acceleration of the earth, as recorded by the Chilean National Network of Accelerographs during the seism. In parallel, a screen is displaying the full progression of the earthquake’s data, showing one slide per second for the 146 seconds of the duration of the natural phenomena.

The data source was taken from RENADIC Universidad de Chile and it’s open to the public in the following link: terremotos.ing.uchile.cl/registros/164. I selected the processed data from Constitución, as this location was the closest one to the epicenter. The data was then transformed to JSON format to be used in the code.

Coded in Javascript and printed using AxiDraw Plotter.

## Roosa-Emilia Ronkainen – Reactive Flowers

In my final project I wanted to combine what I had learned with something I wanted to explore more of. Posenet, a machine learning tool adept at identifying and tracking facial features was something that felt fun and exciting. It brought me a bit of child-like joy – something that is not easily reached anymore. A lot of coding feels quite distant from the user or the viewers so I enjoyed the feeling of connection and instant reaction there was. Interaction between the viewer and the art piece is something that always bring joy to me and makes the experience more impactful. This feeling of play and connection was I focal point of my work.
