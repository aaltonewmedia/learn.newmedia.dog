## Guidelines

Students should complete a final project, either individually or in a small group (max. 3 students), that explores electronics as a creative medium.

Some common topics that could be good starting points if you are still looking for something to do:
- Tangible user interfaces
- Wearable electronics
- Custom music controllers/instruments
- Synthesizers and sequencers
- Kinetic sculptures
- Simple robots
- Interactive installations 

It is ok to combine this project with the final project of the Computational Art and Design course.

### Additional tips
- Read through Tom Igoe’s post about [Physical Computing’s Greatest Hits and Misses](https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/176/)

- [Making Interactive Art: Set the Stage, Then Shut Up and Listen](https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/405/)
- If you are still a bit uncomfortable with working with electronics, start from simple and expand from there.

## Project Proposal (Deadline: November 12)

Create a project proposal for your final project. Think of this as a constantly evolving document where you take notes on your final project ideas. This deadline is for the first version of this.

- Some short thoughts on what you would like to explore and work with conceptually and technically. What is it that you want to make? How does it look like? What does it do?
- Some references (artworks/projects that are similar to what you would like to do)
- Initial list of parts and components you think you will need

You will present your idea in class on Tuesday (12/11/2024). This is a very uninformal presentation and mainly serves as a way for us to discuss your ideas together.

{{<hint info>}}
It is ok if your idea changes after this. I am expecting it to change or evolve as you learn more about the topic. **You just need a starting point.**
{{</hint>}}

Some of you might also decide to join forces for the final project. You can work as a group of max. 3 students as well for the final project of this course.

## Project Presentations (December 5, 13:00)

- Your project should be ready before 13:00 on December 5.
- Present it either in the Mechatronics workshop just for the class or in the exhibition space (see below).
- We first do presentation in Mechatronics starting at 14:00
- Then we go see the other works still being installed in the exhibition at Marsio.

## Course Exhibition and Demo Day

{{<hint info>}}
**Note that this is voluntary. You do not have to present your work in the exhibition or at Demo Day. You can also just present the project during our last day on Thursday, December 5**
{{</hint>}}

### Winter Demo Day 2024

You can also present or show your work during the Aalto Demo Day on December 11. We also have two spaces for exhibiting work connected to the Demo Day event.  

Please fill out the form if you want to present your work or show it in the exhibition. [Open Call is open now](https://medialabdemoday.aalto.fi/2024-winter/open-call/).

## Project Documentation (Deadline December 17)

**Note! I extended the deadline a little bit**

It is extremely important to document your work well. This is not useful just for this course but for your portfolio as well. Your course website should have a dedicated section(s)/page(s) for your final project.

Minimum documentation consists of:

- A short description of your project and reflection on the things you learned (500-1000 words)
- One photo of the finished work
- One short video of the finished work. **Please send this separatewly to Matti, check your email for instructions on how to submit it. The repository cannot handle large files.**

Recommended documentation also would include one or more of the following:

- A more detailed report on the process of creating your work.
- More photos, sketches, high-quality video, process videos.
- A guide/tutorial on how to build your project from the technical side. 

**No separate assignment submission to MyCourses, just use the website that you have been using for the course. Except for the video file, send that separately on [MyCourses here.](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/mod/panoptosubmission/view.php?id=1429735)**

{{<hint info>}}
### Video Specifications

Please follow these specifications:

- Horizontal video in 16:9 aspect ratio **(No vertical videos)**.
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or 3840x2160
- .mp4 with H264 compression
- 30fps (or 60fps if it is really needed for your project)

#### Recommended Preset from HandBrake 

- Download and install [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)
- Open your video file
- Choose the following preset: Web --> Creator1080p60 (for 1920x1080 resolution)
- **Go to the Video tab and chnage the frame rate to 30fps**
