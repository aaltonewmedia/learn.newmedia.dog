{{<hint info>}}
For the 2025 course, we are continuing with the way we started in 2024. Matti has been setting up a website at [physcomp.newmedia.dog](https://physcomp.newmedia.dog/) for archiving the course work from this course..

I am still figuring out some of the ways this could be done as smooth as possible, so please bear with me if/when there are some hiccups.

## Instructions

1. Fill in the form on MyCourses so that I can prepare the access for you.
2. You will get your own section on the website under the 2024 page: [physcomp.newmedia.dog/2025/](https://physcomp.newmedia.dog/2025/)
3. Click the login link on the top of the page and login with the username and password that you can find in MyCourses.
4. You can start adding new pages by using the content-management system.
5. Once you click Publish, it will take a minute or so to update on the site. **Be patient!**

## How does it work?

1. When you make a change and publish it, it will update [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/aaltonewmedia/physcomp.newmedia.dog) with a new commit.
2. You can see [the commits here](https://github.com/aaltonewmedia/physcomp.newmedia.dog/commits/main/).
3. You can see the structure of your own section [here](https://github.com/aaltonewmedia/physcomp.newmedia.dog). (go to content/2025/your-name)
4. After a commit has been made, the site gets built and published on Netlify. **This takes a minute or two so be patient!**
