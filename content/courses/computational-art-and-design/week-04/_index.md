## Absence Compensation

If you miss the classes this week and you are going over the 20% allowed absence, you can compensate for them with these exercises from the [course book](https://primo.aalto.fi/permalink/358AALTO_INST/ha1cg5/alma999439982606526):

Any of these exercises:
- **Image**
  - Collage Machine
  - Color of a Pixel
- **Sound**
  - Theremin
- **Time and Interractivity**
  - Audio-Sensitive Animation
- **Color**
  - Color Inspector

**Choose one exercise per missed day of class.** Add your sketches to our [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/class/101465#/) class. There is a collection specifically for this. Name your file with the date that you are compensating for and the exercise name from the book. For example, `06/09 Butt Generator`.
