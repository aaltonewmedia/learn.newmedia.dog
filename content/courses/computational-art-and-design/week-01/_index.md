## Absence Compensation

If you miss the classes this week and you are going over the 20% allowed absence, you can compensate for them with these exercises from the [course book](https://primo.aalto.fi/permalink/358AALTO_INST/ha1cg5/alma999439982606526):

- Any of these exercises from the **Graphic Elements (p. 413)**, **Color (p.427)**, or **Curves (p. 468)** sections:
  - Graphic Elements: One with Everything
  - Graphic Elements: Quadrilateral Zoo
  - Graphic Elements: Draw Your Initials
  - Graphic Elements: Coding Mondrian
  - Graphic Elements: Coding Stadia II
  - Graphic Elements: Draw, Then Code
  - Color: Color Observation
  - Color: Overlapping Color
  - Color: Threshold of Perception
  - Curves: Butt Generator

  **Choose one exercise per missed day of class.** Add your sketches to our [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org/class/101465#/) class. There is a collection specifically for this. Name your file with the date that you are compensating for and the exercise name from the book. For example, `06/09 Butt Generator`.
