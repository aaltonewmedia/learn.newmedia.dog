## Guidelines

- Use what you have learned to create a project that explores programming as a creative medium.
- Your project could be a printed image, interactive installation, game, experimental instrument, generative artwork etc.
- Use whatever tools you like. p5.js or Processing are the suggested ones as we have been learning those, but you are also allowed to use some other programming languages/environments. I might just not be able to help you if you decide to use something more exotic. If you took the Audiovisual Studio workshop, you might also want to consider using TouchDesigner for your project.
- Remember “Poems, not demos”.

### There is no specific theme, brief or client?

No, I want you to be able to find your own motivation, goals and ideas. How can programming connect to your existing practice? What is it that **you** want to create?

### I cannot think of anything to do?

Here are some suggestions for simple projects:

- Any of the larger **assignments** from the book [Code as Creative Medium](https://primo.aalto.fi/permalink/358AALTO_INST/ha1cg5/alma999439982606526) would be suitable as a final project.
- Try to re-create some simple game like Pong, Breakout, Asteroids etc. Add your own twist to it.
- Generative art/design system with an interface that allows you to alter the visual output and save the result as an image. The interface could be digital on the screen or something tangible that you create in Physical Computing.
- A simple data visualization of some dataset that you find interesting.
- [See some examples from earlier years](../showcase/)

### Combined Final Project with Physical Computing?

You can combine the final project of this course to the one you are working on in Physical Computing. For example, you create some type of interactive installation that has a physical interface combined to immersive generative graphics, or you can make a simple game with a custom controller etc.

## Deliverables

### Project Proposal (Friday, November 7)

Submit a link to an online document or a pdf file (Miro board, [Physical Computing courses site](https://physcomp.newmedia.dog/), Google Doc, OneDrive etc). of your project proposal [via MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/mod/assign/view.php?id=1263273). It should include the following:
- A short description of your idea. What do you want to do? Why?
- How are you going to do it? Do you think you need some special software libraries? Are there some things that you do not have any idea how to even get started with? Are you using p5.js or something else?
- Open questions that you have about the project or the implementation.
- 1-3 examples of works that other people have done that are similar.
- Are you combining this project with another course? (Physical Computing 21st Century Art & Science Lab, Storytelling etc.)

{{<hint info>}}
Note that your project can and probaly will change as you work on it. This is totally ok. Think of this document as a notebook that you keep updating as you work on your idea. Keep on adding references, code samples, sketches etc. to this "notebook"

**Ideally, this should be something where Matti could directly add some comments.**
{{</hint>}}

**Present your idea in class on Friday, November 8.**

### Final Project Presentation (Friday, November 29)

You should present your project in class on Friday, November 29. We start presentations at 9:15 AM. This might still be work-in-progress if you are combining this with Physical Computing. This is ok. Just present whatever stage it is at on this day.

---

### Final Project Documentation (Friday, December 12)

You should send me documentation of the project via [MyCourses (link coming later)]().

- a .pdf file that shortly explains your project (500–1000 words)
  - If your project is combined with Physical Computing, it's also ok to just submit link to your final project page.
- .zip archive of all of the files and code of your project
- at least one image of the project as a separate file (.png or .jpg)
- a short video capture of the project (can be screen capture or shot with a camera if there is some physical component). 
- *optional: a url to a website if you have published the work or some type of write-up about it.*

Also include the answer to the following questions:
1. Can I add the video of your projet to our [class showcase](../showcase/)?
2. Can I upload the video file to the Media Lab Vimeo channel (the video will be much better quality this way)
3. Can I publish your name on the site?
4. Would you like me to add a link to your portfolio website, social media account etc. next to the video?

## 2025: Winter Demo Day

{{<hint info>}}
**Note that this is voluntary. You do not have to present your work in the exhibition or at Demo Day. You can also just present the project during our last day on Friday, November 29**
{{</hint>}}

### Exhibition Dates

{{<hint info>}}
- Setting up: December 2–10
- Media Lab Demo Day: Wednesday, December 10 (Demo Day)
{{</hint>}}

### Exhibition Spaces

We have booked one space for Demo Day this year

- Marsio Digital Studio

### Fill in the requirements for your work

If you want to show your work in the exhibition, we need to start gathering equipment for it. I will add a form here soon that you need to fill out. [Registration form coming soon]().
