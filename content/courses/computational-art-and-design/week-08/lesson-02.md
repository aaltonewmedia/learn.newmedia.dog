## Advanced techniques for animating with code

### % remainder

[See the tutorial on the remainder operator](../../../tutorials/p5-js/remainder.md)

### millis()

This technique is very commonly needed with Arduino so you will find this very useful in Physical Computing.

[millis()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/millis)

### noise()

[See the tutorial on noise()](../../../tutorials/p5-js/noise.md)

### sin(), cos()

[See the tutorial on noise()](../../../tutorials/p5-js/trigonometry.md)
