### Final Project Ideation

{{<hint warning>}}
Please note! I had some confusing and conflicting dates in MyCourses and here on this site. Now everything should be up-to-date. I moved the project proposal presentations to Friday (March 14).
{{</hint>}}

- Start to lock down your ideas and approaches for the final project. [See the guidelines here.](../../final-project/).
- Create a project planning document or proposal that you can present in class on **Friday, March 14**. [Submit a link or the document to MyCourses.](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/mod/assign/view.php?id=1321855)
- Already start prototyping and testing some aspects of if you have not done so already

Booking calendar for the studio. If you need to use some of the special equipment like the projectors, lights etc. in the Experimental Studio 1—or just generally plan to come work inside the studio—please mark it in this calendar so that other students know when is a good time to come there.
