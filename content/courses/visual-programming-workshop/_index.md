## Course content

Targeted for artists, designers, and creative technologists, this one-week workshop course introduces you to the fundamentals of node-based programming to build dynamic visuals and interactive experiences without traditional coding. Through lectures, screenings, hands-on projects and guided instruction, you’ll learn to generate real-time graphics, manipulate data inputs, and craft interactive audio-visual experiences.

The main tool used in the workshop is TouchDesigner. Previous experience with the software is not required, but please see other prerequisites.

## Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Apply node-based programming workflows to create interactive visual projects.
- Design and implement audio-reactive visuals and apply real-time video processing techniques using TouchDesigner.
- Analyze and discuss historical and contemporary examples of audiovisual art to inform their own creative practices.
